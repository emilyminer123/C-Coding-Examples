## inversion_counter:
- Uses mergesort to find the number of inversions in an array. There is a slow solution (using nested loops) and a fast solution that uses a modified mergesort to count the number of inversions and return the count. Program defaults to the fast solution unless the user specifies.

## stair_climber:
- Calculates and displays all possible ways to climb an n-stair staircase when you can move up 1, 2, or 3 stairs at a time. Program reads the number of stairs from a command-line argument, finds all combinations of steps to reach the top, and prints the total number of ways along with the step sequences.

## unique_letters:
- Checks whether a string has all unique lowercase letters. Will display error message if input string does not contain all lowercase letters.

## sieve_of_eratosthenes:
- Finds prime numbers using the sieve of Eratosthenes.The program asks the user for a limit and then finds primes up to and including that limit. When there is only one line of prime numbers in the output, the numbers are displayed with one space between each. When there are multiple lines of output, the numbers are right-aligned to the width of the largest prime.
