## inversion_counter:
- Uses mergesort to find the number of inversions in an array. There is a slow solution (using nested loops) and a fast solution that uses a modified mergesort to count the number of inversions and return the count. Program defaults to the fast solution unless the user specifies.

## stair_climber:
- Calculates and displays all possible ways to climb an n-stair staircase when you can move up 1, 2, or 3 stairs at a time. Program reads the number of stairs from a command-line argument, finds all combinations of steps to reach the top, and prints the total number of ways along with the step sequences.

## unique_letters:
- Checks whether a string has all unique lowercase letters. Will display error message if input string does not contain all lowercase letters.
